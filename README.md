![Image of App](https://screens.kinau.systems/b4a1cd70-3aa1-478b-a6bd-71934cbd71e5.png)

## Description
A simple (and crappy) Android-App to register without scanning a QR-Code and enter your student ID

## How to use
1. Download the apk from [here](https://github.com/MrKinau/HSWormsCorona/releases/tag/1.0.0)
2. Open the apk on an android device (You have to allow to install apps from unknown sources).
3. Start the app.
4. Open the settings (top right corner) and set your student ID.
5. Add all required rooms with the button on the bottom right corner.

### Check in to a room
Click on the card with the room you want to check in.
**Please check the Toast, which will appear if you checked in.**

### Check out of a room
Either click on the checkout button in the notification or click onto the checkout button which will appear if you are currently checked into any room.
**Please check the Toast, which will appear if you checked out.**

## Why?
1. No QR-Code scan required
2. You do not have to type your student ID every time you want to check in
3. You do not forget to check out, because you get reminded by a notification
4. Why not?
